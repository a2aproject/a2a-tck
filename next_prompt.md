# Next Session Prompt: A2A TCK Phase 4+ Implementation

## Context
I need you to continue implementing the A2A TCK mandatory/optional test separation plan. We have successfully completed Phases 1-3 of the implementation detailed in `@phase2-plan.md`. Please review the current status and continue from Phase 4.

## Current Status Summary

### Completed Phases ‚úÖ
- **Phase 1**: ‚úÖ Removed all SUT workarounds (from `@WORKING_NOTES.md`)
- **Phase 2**: ‚úÖ Created test categorization with markers system
- **Phase 3**: ‚úÖ Directory reorganization + specialized runners + comprehensive main script

### Phase 3 Achievement Details (from `@WORKING_NOTES_PHASE2.md`):
- **Test Organization**: Created `tests/mandatory/`, `tests/optional/capabilities/`, `tests/optional/quality/`, `tests/optional/features/` directories
- **Test Movement**: Successfully moved all 18 test files to categorized directories
- **Specialized Runners**: Created `run_mandatory.py`, `run_capabilities.py`, `run_quality.py`, `run_features.py`
- **Main Script Rewrite**: Completely rewrote `run_tck.py` with category-based execution
- **Validation Results**: All categories tested successfully:
  - `mandatory`: 24 tests (22 pass, 2 fail) - shows real compliance issues
  - `capabilities`: 14 tests (5 pass, 6 fail) - shows false advertising issues
  - `quality`: 12 tests (10 pass, 2 fail) - shows production concerns  
  - `features`: 16 tests (12 pass, 2 fail) - shows basic implementation

### Current Implementation Status:
- **Directory structure**: ‚úÖ Complete and working
- **Specialized runners**: ‚úÖ All working with rich documentation
- **Main script**: ‚úÖ `run_tck.py` completely rewritten with categories
- **Marker system**: ‚úÖ Applied to mandatory tests only
- **Path-based execution**: ‚úÖ Working for capabilities/quality/features directories

## What Needs to be Done Next

### Phase 4: Implement Capability-Based Test Logic
According to `@phase2-plan.md`, we need to:

#### Task 4.1: Create Capability Analyzer
- Build `tests/capability_validator.py` class to validate declared capabilities
- Implement logic to check Agent Card capabilities vs. required tests
- Handle capability-dependent test selection (MUST pass if declared, SKIP if not)

#### Task 4.2: Update Capability Tests
- Apply `@optional_capability` markers to tests in `tests/optional/capabilities/`
- Implement conditional mandatory logic (skip if capability not declared)
- Update existing capability tests to use the new validation system

### Phase 5: Create Compliance Report Generator  
According to `@phase2-plan.md`:

#### Task 5.1: Build Report Generator
- Create `generate_compliance_report.py`
- Categorize test results and calculate compliance percentages
- Generate comprehensive compliance reports

#### Task 5.2: Create Compliance Levels
- Define compliance levels (MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED, FULL_FEATURED)
- Create badge system for compliance levels

### Phase 6: Documentation and Final Cleanup
According to `@phase2-plan.md`:

#### Task 6.1: Create SDK Validation Guide
- Write comprehensive validation guide for SDK developers
- Document common issues and fixes

#### Task 6.2: Update Test Documentation
- Add specification references to ALL tests
- Standardize documentation format

#### Task 6.3: Create Migration Guide
- Document changes from previous TCK version
- Guide for SDK developers on fixing issues

## Important Notes

### Current Marker Implementation Status:
- **Mandatory tests**: ‚úÖ Have proper `@mandatory_jsonrpc` and `@mandatory_protocol` markers
- **Capability tests**: ‚ùå Need `@optional_capability` markers applied
- **Quality tests**: ‚ùå Need `@quality_basic` markers applied  
- **Feature tests**: ‚ùå Need `@optional_feature` markers applied

### Current Working State:
- **Git branch**: `feat/mandatory-optional-test-separation`
- **SUT**: Running on http://localhost:9999
- **Test execution**: Working for all categories via path-based selection
- **Marker system**: Working for mandatory tests, needs application to other categories

### Key Files to Reference:
- `@phase2-plan.md` - Complete implementation plan with detailed tasks
- `@WORKING_NOTES_PHASE2.md` - Current progress and achievements  
- `@WORKING_NOTES.md` - Phase 1 background (SUT workaround removal)
- `tests/markers.py` - Marker definitions already created
- `run_tck.py` - Main script (just completed rewrite)

### Validation Approach:
After each phase, run the test suite to ensure:
1. No regressions in existing functionality
2. New features work as expected
3. All categories still execute correctly via `run_tck.py`

## Starting Instructions

Please:
1. Review the current status in `@WORKING_NOTES_PHASE2.md`
2. Check the detailed plan in `@phase2-plan.md` 
3. Start with Phase 4 Task 4.1: Create Capability Analyzer
4. Follow the guiding principles: SDK Purity, Clear Categories, Specification Truth, Fail Fast, Progressive Enhancement, Documentation
5. Test each change before moving to the next task
6. Update `WORKING_NOTES_PHASE2.md` with progress

Let's continue building the best A2A specification compliance validator! üöÄ
