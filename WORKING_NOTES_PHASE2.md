## Phase 3 Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

### Task 3.1: Create Test Organization ✅
- **DONE**: Created organized directory structure
- **Files**: All test directories with proper `__init__.py` and README.md files

### Task 3.2: Move Tests to Appropriate Directories ✅
- **DONE**: Moved all 18 test files to categorized directories
- **Script**: `reorganize_tests.py` executed successfully  
- **Verification**: All tests still discoverable and functional

### Task 3.3: Create Test Suite Runners ✅
- **DONE**: Created specialized runners for each category
- **Files**: `run_mandatory.py`, `run_capabilities.py`, `run_quality.py`, `run_features.py`
- **Features**: Rich documentation, consistent interface, actionable guidance

### Task 3.4: Update Main TCK Runner ✅
- **DONE**: Completely rewrote `run_tck.py` without backward compatibility
- **Features**: 
  - Category-based test execution (mandatory, capabilities, quality, features, all)
  - Built-in `--explain` functionality with comprehensive guidance
  - Intelligent assessment with detailed summary reports
  - Progressive workflow (mandatory → capabilities → quality → features)
  - Smart exit codes (fail only on mandatory/capabilities issues)

#### Test Results from Validation:
```
Category        Tests    Passed  Failed  Skipped  Xfailed  Status
mandatory       24       22      2       -        -        ❌ Issues (compliance blocking)
capabilities    14       5       6       1        2        ❌ Issues (false advertising)  
quality         12       10      2       -        -        ⚠️  Needs attention
features        16       12      2       1        1        ℹ️  Basic (perfectly fine)
```

**Key Findings:**
- **A2A Compliance**: FAILED due to JSON-RPC violations + historyLength issues
- **Capability Honesty**: FAILED due to undeclared capabilities being tested
- **Production Quality**: Issues with edge case handling
- **Feature Completeness**: Basic implementation (acceptable)

#### Script Testing Results:
✅ `--explain` - Beautiful category guide with decision tree
✅ `--category mandatory` - Runs 24 tests with proper markers  
✅ `--category capabilities` - Runs 14 tests (path-based since markers not fully applied)
✅ `--category quality` - Runs 12 tests (path-based)
✅ `--category features` - Runs 16 tests (path-based)  
✅ `--category all` - Comprehensive workflow with intelligent summary

## Current Status: Phase 2 COMPLETE ✅

**Progress Summary:**
- **Phase 1**: ✅ SUT workarounds removed, SDK purity achieved
- **Phase 2**: ✅ Test categorization with specification-based markers  
- **Phase 3**: ✅ Directory reorganization + specialized runners + comprehensive main script

**Phase 2 Achievement Highlights:**
1. **Specification-Driven Testing**: TCK validates ANY A2A implementation against spec requirements
2. **Clear Compliance Categories**: Mandatory vs optional tests with proper documentation
3. **Actionable Test Selection**: Can run specific compliance levels with meaningful feedback
4. **SDK-Agnostic Validation**: Tests focus on specification compliance, not SDK implementation
5. **Proper Failure Exposure**: Tests correctly expose non-compliance (historyLength, JSON-RPC issues)
6. **Production-Ready Organization**: Clear structure with specialized runners for different needs
7. **Comprehensive User Experience**: Built-in guidance, decision trees, intelligent summaries

**Next Steps (Future Phases):**
- Phase 4: Apply markers to remaining test files (capabilities, quality, features)
- Phase 5: Capability-based conditional testing logic
- Phase 6: Compliance report generation and SDK validation guides

**Ready for Commit**: All changes tested and verified working correctly.
