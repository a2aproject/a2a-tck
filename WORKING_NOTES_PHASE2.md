## Phase 3 Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

### Task 3.1: Create Test Organization ✅
- **DONE**: Created organized directory structure
- **Files**: All test directories with proper `__init__.py` and README.md files

### Task 3.2: Move Tests to Appropriate Directories ✅
- **DONE**: Moved all 18 test files to categorized directories
- **Script**: `reorganize_tests.py` executed successfully  
- **Verification**: All tests still discoverable and functional

### Task 3.3: Create Test Suite Runners ✅
- **DONE**: Created specialized runners for each category
- **Files**: `run_mandatory.py`, `run_capabilities.py`, `run_quality.py`, `run_features.py`
- **Features**: Rich documentation, consistent interface, actionable guidance

### Task 3.4: Update Main TCK Runner ✅
- **DONE**: Completely rewrote `run_tck.py` without backward compatibility
- **Features**: 
  - Category-based test execution (mandatory, capabilities, quality, features, all)
  - Built-in `--explain` functionality with comprehensive guidance
  - Intelligent assessment with detailed summary reports
  - Progressive workflow (mandatory → capabilities → quality → features)
  - Smart exit codes (fail only on mandatory/capabilities issues)

#### Test Results from Validation:
```
Category        Tests    Passed  Failed  Skipped  Xfailed  Status
mandatory       24       22      2       -        -        ❌ Issues (compliance blocking)
capabilities    14       5       6       1        2        ❌ Issues (false advertising)  
quality         12       10      2       -        -        ⚠️  Needs attention
features        16       12      2       1        1        ℹ️  Basic (perfectly fine)
```

**Key Findings:**
- **A2A Compliance**: FAILED due to JSON-RPC violations + historyLength issues
- **Capability Honesty**: FAILED due to undeclared capabilities being tested
- **Production Quality**: Issues with edge case handling
- **Feature Completeness**: Basic implementation (acceptable)

#### Script Testing Results:
✅ `--explain` - Beautiful category guide with decision tree
✅ `--category mandatory` - Runs 24 tests with proper markers  
✅ `--category capabilities` - Runs 14 tests (path-based since markers not fully applied)
✅ `--category quality` - Runs 12 tests (path-based)
✅ `--category features` - Runs 16 tests (path-based)  
✅ `--category all` - Comprehensive workflow with intelligent summary

## Phase 4 Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

### Task 4.1: Create Capability Analyzer ✅
- **DONE**: Created comprehensive `tests/capability_validator.py`
- **Features**:
  - `CapabilityValidator` class for Agent Card analysis
  - Capability-to-test mapping for streaming, pushNotifications, authentication
  - Modality support validation (text, file, data)
  - Conditional mandatory logic (skip if not declared, mandatory if declared)
  - `skip_if_capability_not_declared()` decorator for test functions
  - `requires_modality()` decorator for modality-dependent tests
  - Capability consistency validation and issue detection

### Task 4.2: Update Capability Tests ✅
- **DONE**: Updated all capability tests with new validation system
- **Files Updated**:
  - `test_streaming_methods.py`: All streaming tests now use `@optional_capability` + `CapabilityValidator`
  - `test_push_notification_config_methods.py`: All push notification tests updated
  - Applied conditional mandatory logic: SKIP if capability not declared, MANDATORY if declared
  - Enhanced documentation with clear specification section references
  - Proper error messages indicating specification violations

### Task 4.3: Update Quality/Feature Tests ✅  
- **DONE**: Applied appropriate markers to quality and feature tests
- **Files Updated**:
  - `test_concurrency.py`: Applied `@quality_production` and `@quality_basic` markers
  - `test_edge_cases.py`: Applied `@quality_basic` and `@quality_production` markers  
  - `test_sdk_limitations.py`: Applied `@optional_feature` marker
  - Enhanced all test documentation with proper categorization explanations

#### Test Results from Validation:
```
Category        Tests    Passed  Skipped  Failed  Xfailed  Status
capabilities    14       5        5        2       2        ✅ Working correctly!
```

**Key Findings from Phase 4:**
- **Capability Validation Working**: 5 tests properly skipped when capabilities not declared
- **False Advertising Detection**: 2 failures show SUT implements streaming without declaring it
- **Conditional Mandatory Logic**: Tests correctly become mandatory when capabilities are declared
- **Specification Compliance**: Clear violations now properly detected and reported

#### Phase 4 Achievement Highlights:
1. **Conditional Mandatory Testing**: Tests skip appropriately or become mandatory based on Agent Card declarations
2. **False Advertising Detection**: Catches implementations that work but don't declare capabilities
3. **Clear Specification Violations**: Enhanced error messages cite specific A2A specification sections
4. **Robust Capability Analysis**: Comprehensive validation of Agent Card vs. actual implementation
5. **Proper Test Categorization**: All tests now have appropriate markers and documentation
6. **SDK-Agnostic Validation**: System works for any A2A implementation regardless of SDK

## Current Status: Phase 4 COMPLETE ✅

**Progress Summary:**
- **Phase 1**: ✅ SUT workarounds removed, SDK purity achieved
- **Phase 2**: ✅ Test categorization with specification-based markers  
- **Phase 3**: ✅ Directory reorganization + specialized runners + comprehensive main script
- **Phase 4**: ✅ Capability-based test logic + marker application + conditional mandatory testing

**Phase 4 Achievement Summary:**
1. **Specification-Driven Capability Testing**: Tests validate declared capabilities vs. actual implementation
2. **Conditional Mandatory Logic**: Smart skipping/mandatory based on Agent Card declarations
3. **False Advertising Detection**: Catches capabilities that work but aren't declared
4. **Enhanced Test Documentation**: All tests cite specific specification sections
5. **Complete Marker System**: All test categories properly marked and categorized
6. **Robust Validation Framework**: CapabilityValidator provides comprehensive analysis tools

**Next Steps (Remaining Phases):**
- Phase 5: Compliance report generation and validation levels
- Phase 6: Documentation and SDK validation guides

**Ready for Phase 5**: All capability validation logic implemented and tested successfully.
